flexor
======

Flexor is a JavaScript ARM emulator, closely emulating the ARM7TMDI 3-staged pipeline processor. It currently implements a subset of the THUMB ARMv5 ISA. It was originally created as an academic tool to learn the inner workings of a processor which I developed as a graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology under Bruce McNair. 

Getting Started
===============

Read the document JavaScriptArmEmulator.pdf in the repository on details of the architecture. All details of the project are contained in this document.

Running the Emulator
====================

Open flexor.html in a HTML5 compliant browser.


Future Improvements
===================

Only a select few instructions are implemented. Much more work needs to be addressed until a fully operational program can be emulated.
